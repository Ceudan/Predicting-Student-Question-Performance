# Predicting-Student-Question-Performance
I led a team of 3 to design an ensemble machine learning model to predict whether a student can correctly anwser a specific diagnositic question. Data includes performance of the same student on other questions, and performance of other students. Our ensemble combined 3 distinct machine learning architectures (K-Nearest Neighbors, Item-Response Theory, Autoencoder) each with bagging to maximize accuracy.
